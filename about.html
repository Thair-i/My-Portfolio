      Hello! Welcome to my portfolio! It's such a pleasure to have you here and
      an honor to introduce my work to you. My name is Thair. Iâ€™m a traveler and
      web developer with a background in Mechanical Engineering; which is close
      to my current work field as well. I have always wanted to to grow and
      enhance my knowledge into a more complex branch of Engineering. I joined
      the Coding Bootcamp at the University of Washington to pursue my dream and
      become a Web Developer in a high Tech company. It was a challenging course
      with great knowledge that boosted my skills and confidence in Software
      Engineering. As you explore my portfolio, you'll notice that I have worked
      on a lot of different web projects. Thank you for visiting!
